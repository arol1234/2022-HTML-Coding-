            As seen from these graphs we can say that low education does end up with poverty.As a matter of fact In most cases this just keeps cycling and the quality of life of these people will just keep getting worse. As a matter of fact, the people in these targeted areas of poverty make 1.90$ and roughly have 5 people to share it with. Another fact is that 30 million American kids come to school for food and even then they get 1 below average meal.From malnutrition they are not able to focus on their education. Finally 6/73 of  children in these targeted areas of poor education suffer from starvation and have not eaten today while you are reading this.  The only way that we could help them is by spreading awareness and if you are able to donate money on the second page that would be greatly appreciated.
